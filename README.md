# KnapsackProject

This project is meant to accomplish two things:
- Become acclimated to Kotlin...this is my first time coding in it
- Recall a past algorithm from CS302 Algorithms and Complexity

It is not meant to:
- provide actual insight as the application of this algorithm doesn't actually work for a 2D space

This project uses the Knapsack algorithm to "determine" how many items can fit in a certain space. It doesn't really apply to this problem in reality as there are contraints depending on the actual dimensions, not merely the area. Nonetheless, I was able to code for the first time in Kotlin and practice algorithms in this project.
